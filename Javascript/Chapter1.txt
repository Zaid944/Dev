everything happens in a execution context
Javascript is synchronous and single threaded
Code -> Thread of Execution -> Line by Line execution of Code 
Memory -> Variable Environment

Run a JS Program -> Execution context

Memmory creation
first all program is scanned and variable is stored
then code execution
then the execution context for the fn will be deleted

call stack -> execution order of execution context
